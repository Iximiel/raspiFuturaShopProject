I do a rewrite of the code from the book "Raspberry Pi il mio primo linux embedded" from python to C++

The raspberry hat that I'll use is [this](https://www.futurashop.it/shield-raspberry-io-7100-ft1060m)

The book is [this](https://www.futurashop.it/libro-raspberry-pi-il-mio-primo-linux-embedded-8330-raspbook1), but probaly I'm using and old edition.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- i2c

## Differences from original

- C++
- I would recomend to use a git repo
